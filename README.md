Track Class Availability
========================

Track Class Availability (trackClassAvailability.py) is a tool written in Python (2.7) that allows a user to track numerous classes through WebTMS. The user can choose whether to be notified when a section opens or closes. Track Class Availability will then check all your classes via WebTMS every hour to see if the sections you are tracking open or close. If the classes you are tracking open or close, you will be notified of the status change via email.

##To-Do

  	1.Track multiple classes (Priority and an easy fix)
	2. Check if the program works with the major e-mail providers, currently only tested with gmail.
	3. Go through and add features that are on the `Planned Features` list

##Planned Features
	1. Track multiple classes (Right now I don't have it going through the whole text file, only the first line to test if it works.)
	2. Add a configuration file that allows a user to set the frequency that the program checks WebTMS, change the from email address, change the to email address and other configurations I probably can't think of right now.
	3. Check if a professor is added to the section you want and email you when a professor is assigned to a section.
	4. Any other features that I think of or users think of, we can add or remove features from the list as we please.
